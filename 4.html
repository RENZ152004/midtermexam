<h1>bumbbells</h1>
<p>The dumbbell is a type of exercise equipment 
used in weight training. Specifically, dumbbells 
are weights used without exercise machines. Dumbbells 
are sometimes also called hand weights and free weights—those 
used “free” of such equipment. Most dumbbells are designed with 
a narrow bar in the middle and two wider discs at each end. Some 
dumbbells are very light in weight (only a few pounds)
 while others are very heavy (50 pounds or more).</p>
