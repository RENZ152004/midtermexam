<h1> treadmill</h1>
<p>A treadmill, also known as a running machine, is a piece of gym equipment that allows a person to walk or run in one place. It typically consists of a moving belt on which a person can walk or run, powered by an electric motor. Most treadmills allow the user to adjust the speed and incline of the belt, and many also have built-in workout programs and features such as heart rate monitors and calorie counters. Treadmills are a popular choice for at-home cardio exercise, as they can provide an effective workout without the need to go outside.</p>
